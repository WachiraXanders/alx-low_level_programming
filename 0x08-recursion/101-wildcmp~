/**
	*wildcmp - this line defines the function wildcmp with
	*two parameters both of which are pointers to characters
	*this function will compare two strings.
	*@s1: The first pointer to character due to the use
	*of 'char' therefore  meaning that char *s1 represents a
	*string of characters and the pointer points to the
	*first character of the string.
	*@s2 : Another pointer to a character of the second
	*string.
	*If both strings are empty they are considered same.
	*Equate each  string pointer to zero
	*Return one to mean that they are equal.
	*If both characters match or if *S2 has a wild card,return
	*and call back the function incrementing one in each.
	*The wildcmp(s1, s2 + 1) helps the * match with an empty
	*string
	*If they don't match and there is no *s2 then it should
	*return 0.
	*Return: As follows above.
